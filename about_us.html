                    <p>
                        Suka Dessert is owned by Siti Hajar Mohd Razali. She is also known as Auntie Ja. Her business gained a lot attentions by the users of social media.
                        She initially started her business with her family in her backyard. Due to the restricted space in the backyard, there are only a few seats and tables available for guests. 
                        However, on a daily basis, a large number of clients arrive there. In fact, tourists from other states learn about Suka Dessert and go to Selayang, Kuala Lumpur, solely for 
                        the sake of its delights. However, she now owned a dessert shop that could serve a big number of people and hold a wide range of sweets in her refrigerated dessert display.
